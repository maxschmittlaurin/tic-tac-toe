## Description

This is a tic tac toe game where the player can't ever hope to win against the AI. The program uses the [Minimax algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/)
to determine what are the best moves for the AI to play in order to prevent the player from winning.
